# Homebrew formula for mdmost. This repository is its own tap:
#
#   brew tap oetiker/mdmost https://github.com/oetiker/mdmost
#   brew install mdmost
#
# The version and the four sha256 lines are rewritten by .github/workflows/release.yml
# after the release artifacts exist. The trailing marker comments are what that
# rewrite matches on — do not remove them.

  # Bottles exist for one reason: without one, Homebrew treats this formula as a source
  # build and refuses to install on a Mac whose Command Line Tools are older than its
  # macOS, even though nothing here is compiled. The block is rewritten by
  # .github/workflows/release.yml once a release's bottles exist, and the marker
  # comments are the range that rewrite replaces — do not remove them. Empty means no
  # bottle is published yet, which costs nothing but that check.
  #
  # One bottle per architecture is enough: on macOS, Homebrew falls back to a bottle
  # built for an *older* macOS of the same architecture (find_older_compatible_tag in
  # extend/os/mac/utils/bottles.rb), so these keep working on later releases. That
  # fallback only reaches upward, which is why the bottles are built on the oldest
  # runner image available for each architecture.
